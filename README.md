## Terms of Use:
* Please use Chrome Browser, because cache-clearing function doesn't work in Safari
* You must use from MWireless or public wifi to avoid overloading requests. Should your requests be overloaded on a public IP address, limit your search terms until requests are met. Once those search terms are cached, you can try comparing the multiple terms again.
* If you were met with an error, reduce your search terms. You were likely caught by Google for breaching terms of service (see previous bullet)
