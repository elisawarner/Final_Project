# Final_Project: Google Scholar Comparator
*Regenerated from my previous git folder called "Final_Project"*

**What it does:**
* Accepts multiple Google Scholar search terms separated by a comma (up to 5 is suitable for the graphic). Returns a graphic of boxplots to describe the distribution of number of citations of top search results for Google Scholar in that field. Also returns 

### Program Requirements:
* **You must use a Mac computer** (*Backend was changed to tkAgg. Should work in Windows too but not tested*)
* Please use Chrome Browser, because cache-clearing function doesn't work in Safari
* You must use from MWireless or public wifi to avoid overloading requests. Should your requests be overloaded on a public IP address, limit your search terms until requests are met. Once those search terms are cached, you can try comparing the multiple terms again.
* If you were met with an error, reduce your search terms. You were likely overloaded requests (see previous bullet)
* Program requires python 3.6 installed with packages located in *requirements.txt*
* Make sure to update *config.py* with the appropriate database name and database user

## How to run:
1. Download packages in *requirements.txt*
